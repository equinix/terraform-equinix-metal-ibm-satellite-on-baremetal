# Automated IBM Cloud Satellite on Equinix Metal

These files will allow you to use [Terraform](http://terraform.io) to deploy [IBM Cloud Satellite](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-getting-started) on [Equinix Metal's Bare Metal Cloud offering](http://metal.equinix.com).

Default values for this initial module version will bring up 3 nodes for the IBM Satellite Control Plane cluster and 3 worker nodes to assign them to data plane clusters later. The 3 worker nodes will appear in the IBM Cloud Satellite console as not assigned to any cluster. As next steps, the user will be responsible for attach these worker nodes to a satellite enabled service. For example, [creating a Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud™ clusters in an IBM Cloud™ Satellite location.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=openshift-satellite-clusters) 

Terraform will create RHEL machines for your IBM Cloud Satellite on Baremetal cluster registered to IBM Cloud®.

Users are responsible for providing their Equinix Metal account, and IBM Satellite subscription as described in this readme.

The build (with default settings) typically takes 60-90 minutes.

## Pre-Requisites

To use these Terraform files, you need to have the following Prerequisites:

* An Equinix Metal org-id and a [user-level Equinix Metal API key](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/accounts/users/#api-keys) 
  or a [project-level Equinix Metal API Key](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/accounts/projects/#api-keys)
* An Equinix Metal account, with the ability to provision servers, and the ability to SSH into them, and an user or project Equinix Metal API Key
* Set up an IBM Cloud® account if you do not have one already, and an IBM Cloud API Key
* Set up IBM Cloud® CLI or permission to use IBM Cloud Shell® 
* Terraform, it is a single binary file. Visit their download page choose the specific OS. Once downloaded make the binary executable and move into your environment path
* Git Clone IBM Cloud Satellite on bare-metal repo here

## Install tools

### Install Terraform

Terraform is just a single binary. Visit their [download page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html), choose your operating system, make the binary executable, and move it into your path.

Here is an example for **macOS**:

```bash
curl -LO https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.2/terraform_0.14.2_darwin_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.14.2_darwin_amd64.zip
chmod +x terraform
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
rm -f terraform_0.14.2_darwin_amd64.zip
```

Here is an example for **Linux**:

```bash
curl -LO https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.2/terraform_0.14.2_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.14.2_linux_amd64.zip
chmod +x terraform
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
rm -f terraform_0.14.2_linux_amd64.zip
```

## Deploy the IBM Cloud Satellite cluster on Equinix Metal

To facilitate the deployment we have included a template that can be used to define your own terraform.tfvars file.
There you will find the main required variables. For a complete list of all customizable variables look at the variables.tf file.
Rename the template to terraform.tfvars and use your favorite text editor to define the required variables  

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars
vi terraform.tfvars
```

The table below describes the variables included in the terraform.tfvars.template file:

Deploy the Equinix Metal IBM Satellite cluster:

First, it is highly recommended running a terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure:

```bash
terraform plan
```

All there is left to do now is to deploy the cluster:

```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

This should end with output similar to this:

```console
Apply complete! Resources: 22 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

Control_Plane_public_IPs = [
  "147.75.47.19",
  "147.75.55.171",
  "147.75.55.211",
]
Equinix_project_ID = "af5b81d0-789d-456g-9900-e3d4ec36fb04"
SSH_key_location = "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/metal-ibm-satellite-prod-2x9hm"
Worker_public_IPs = [
  "139.178.85.221",
  "139.178.86.100",
  "139.178.86.50",
]
```

## NOTE

After assigning the host to a cluster, SSH access is disabled and access to the host is controlled via [IBM Cloud IAM access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users)
